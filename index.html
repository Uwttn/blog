            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I enjoy writing about philosophies and/or contemplating ideas. Overall, I think the
                best conversations I have had included with something new to learn or a new way to look at life. And
                sometimes, my own philosophies are not in agreement with other people, and that is okay. There are two
                quotes (I created), however, that I believe are guiding principles to the way I think. These two quotes
                are
                meant to be for me, and for others who may appreciate it.
                The quotes are as followed:
                <li>
                    <em>True love is to accept people for who they are.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Happiness is temporary and happens only in special occassions; peace is a much
                        worthiergoal.</em>
                </li>
            </p>
            <h1>Work Philosophy</h1>
            <p>
                When it comes to work, consistency and having a good system or process is
                often desirable. However, consistency is not always the key. In fact, the only thing that is
                constant in life is <strong>change</strong>. And, eventually, we all have to adapt.
