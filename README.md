# Purpose

A blog with a future use and for people to share and create content. The following is a draft of what my blog would say:

## About Me
In my spare time, I enjoy writing about philosophies and/or contemplating new ideas. Overall, I believe best conversations involve learning something new or gaining a fresh perspective on life. It's okay if my philosophies don't always align with others; differing viewpoints can be enriching. Two quotes I've created, however, are my guiding principles and it might resonate with you too: The quotes are as followed:

- True love is to accept people for who they are.
- Happiness is temporary and happens only in special occassions; peace is a much worthier goal.

## Work Philosophy
When it comes to work, having a consistent system or process is often desirable. However, consistency isn't always the key. The only thing that is constant in life is change, and we all eventually have to adapt.
